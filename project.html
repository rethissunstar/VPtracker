      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        40K War Tools is designed to be a project to make it easier for
        wargamers everywhere. It started with us noticing that the VP was a
        changing value dependent on some of the objectives and location. In some
        cases we were able to use an easy conversion of 3 or 5 VP will equal one
        but some of the missions began having 6 vp or 1vp per thing. Keeping
        track of this stuff for 9th has become a bit arduous. As the codexes are
        not all out for 10th we are still playing 9th edition. Also it would be
        nice to see the rules for at least a couple of armies before I begin
        creating databases. 
        <p>
            So we started with this VP tracker. Hoping you will
        support us on our mission. Constructive feedback always welcome.
